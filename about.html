        <h1><center>Importance of voting</center></h1><br>
<h3><center>1. By voting, we add our voice to the chorus that forms opinions and the basis for actions.<br><br>
2. We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.<br><br>
3. If you donâ€™t vote, you lose the right to complain.<br><br>
4. A man without a vote is a man without protection<br><br>
5. The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all.<br><br>
6. Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost.</center></h3>
